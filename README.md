## Basic Details

**Team Members:**  
- **Team Lead:** Muhammed Swafvan ‚Äì Farook College

## Project Description  
BunkPlanner is a fun, tongue-in-cheek web app that helps college students calculate their attendance percentage and plan their bunking strategy without falling below the college‚Äôs attendance threshold.  

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Students everywhere are plagued with non-existent problems:  
- "How many classes can I bunk before I‚Äôm forced to pay condonation fees?"  
- "What if I want to bunk but also stay safe?"  
- "Why use ChatGPT or Gemini to calculate attendance when you can have a **whole website** for it with an extra step?"  

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We solved this by creating **BunkPlanner**, a calculator that:  
- ‚úÖ Shows current attendance  
- üìâ Calculates effect of bunking/attending  
- üé≠ Gives sassy Malayalam banters instead of boring AI advice  
- üö® Lets you escape the imaginary attendance police
